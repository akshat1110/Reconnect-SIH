            <p>Briefly, your challenge is to connect all the dots on the grid, without leaving any spot empty. You can
                only connect dots of the same color to create a flow between them. The total number of flows equals the
                minimum amount of moves necessary to complete the level in a perfect manner. As the game passes through
                levels, the grid becomes larger, and you are faced with more and more dots, making it increasingly
                difficult to solve the puzzles.Briefly, your challenge is to connect all the dots on the grid, without
