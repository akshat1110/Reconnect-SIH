        <p>In today's world, all of us experience stress no matter what age group we belong to.</p>

        <p>Students go through the stress of building good careers, dealing with peer pressure, keeping up with
            technology,
            and many more. Whereas grownups have to deal with the workload and manage personal and professional life.
            But
            sometimes situations can go out of hand and it becomes obvious to feel anxious or fearful.</p>

        <P>This is the time when self-awareness and expert help comes into play. To be self-aware one will need to
            question
            themselves like "What ", "Why" and "How" a solution to a problem can be figured out. This might help in some
            cases but certainly not always.</P>

        <p>Most of the time people need someone to just hear them out quietly without judging or forcing opinions on
            them,
            but what about the 3 am thoughts? or What if one doesn't have anybody with this much understanding?</p>

        <p>Keeping such thoughts and emotions in our minds we have very mindfully developed this application to cater to
            all
            your emotional and psychological needs. </p>

        <P>With RECONNECT, as the name says, you can reconnect with your inner and peaceful self and trace the
            improvement
            within you through constant efforts. </P>

        <p>Our application is safe for a user of any age since it does not reveal any kind of personal details to the
            public. This way it also eliminates the consciousness of being judged by anyone. You can write and post
            freely
            about anything and everything that you feel and also support others by replying to their posts. The chat
            feature
            enables you to talk to someone as if you are talking to your best friend! The ones who might seek
            professional
            help, need to go nowhere as the application already has a range of suggestions about the experts to whom you
            can
            pour your heart out.</p>

        <p>The sole motive of building RECONNECT is to spread awareness about Mental well-being and offer help to the
            ones
            in need of it.</p>
